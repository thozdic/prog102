# Extracting data ---------------------------------------------------------

# How did you extract the temperature and exposure from the hottest day?
# Copy-paste the code here.

# If you want to change the site and date, what variables would need to change?

# What would you pick for the temperature extraction function name and parameter
# names?


# Writing extraction functions --------------------------------------------

# Write your temperature extraction function here

# Write your exposure extraction function here

# Write your datetime extraction function here

# Visualize Nuka Pass temperatures on 2018-07-01

# How does the visualization code above compare to what you wrote in PROG101?


# Functions within functions (optional) -----------------------------------

# How would you parameterize the visualization code into its own function?
# Specifically, what would you call that function and its parameters?

# Write your wrapper function for plot_kefj(). Call it to compare the
# visualizations for Nuka Pass on July 1, 2018 versus January 1, 2018.
